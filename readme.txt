## 1. Easy to create recipes
Zip Recipes is the fastest way to create a recipe. The best way to build a following is to keep your readers coming back for new recipes for them to try. To speed up your workflow and save you time creating recipes, we provide:

- **Easy Copy & Pasting**: You can copy & paste the recipes you already have from Microsoft Word or other programs.
- **Flexible Editor**: Our flexible editor works how you work by allowing you to add recipes to posts, pages or custom post types.
- **Featured Image Support**: You only have to set one image for your post or page if you use featured images. If you don't provide a recipe image, Zip Recipes will add the featured image to Google's rich snippet.
- **No coding required**: We made Zip Recipes easy to use so you don’t need computer knowledge to start publishing your recipes. Even a complete novice can do it!
- **Extensive support** through knowledgebase articles and responsive support.

## 2. More visitors | Rank higher in Google

- **Mobile friendly**: your recipes will look good on any device.
- **AMP compatible**: out of the box compatible with Google's Accelerated Mobile pages. Zip Recipes will make your recipes load instantly from Google results.
- **Social Media**: Pinterest can also be a huge source of readers for your blog as well. With our JSON-LD recipe markup, your recipes will appear on Pinterest as Rich Recipe Pins. People looking for your type of recipes will discover them and click over to your website giving you an excellent opportunity to build a fan base.

## 3. Professional looking recipes
Some readers need a lot of information before even trying to re-create your recipe.
- **Nutrition information**: Zip Recipes includes nutrition information, cook and prep time, notes and more
- **Rich Snippets**: When users search for recipes, Google will show them the rich snippets with image, rating, nutrition info, cook and preptime, etc.

= How do I edit a recipe with the Zip Recipes plugin? =

To edit or create a recipe, click the Zip Recipes icon on the visual editor toolbar, or in Gutenberg, type in "zip", then click the Zip Recipes icon. More info [here](https://ziprecipes.net/knowledge-base/how-to-use-the-zip-recipes-plugin/).

= Can I use the plugin to add multiple recipes to one post or page? =

There should only be one recipe per post or page. The plugin does allow for compound recipes which is one way to include multiple lists of ingredients in your post. Under “creating a recipe” in the following article you can read how to do that.  [Click here to learn more](https://ziprecipes.net/knowledge-base/how-to-use-the-zip-recipes-plugin/

= When I use Zip Recipe plugin where are the recipes stored? =

Your recipes are always stored on your own website. With Zip Recipes, your recipes are stored safely in a separate database table in your main WordPress database. The recipe table is named wp_amd_zlrecipe_recipes and you can take a look at it yourself using any WordPress database tools at your disposal.

= How about Intellectual Property? =

Your recipes are yours only! They're stored on your own server. Zip Recipes is only a tool to show your recipes on the internet.

= Why do you put a placeholder image into my Edit Post page, instead of my actual recipe? =

Because of the way WordPress' text editor works, if you decide to add or remove something from your recipe using the text editor, it can very easily mess up the markup of the code - so the Zip Recipe plugin prevents that from happening by not allowing you to edit the recipe in the text editor.
