## Easy to use
Zip Recipes is the fastest way to create recipes. The best way to build a following is to keep your readers coming back for new recipes for them to try. To speed up your workflow and save you time creating recipes, we provide:

- **Easy Copy & Pasting**: You can copy & paste the recipes you already have from Microsoft Word or other programs.
- **Flexible Editor**: Our flexible editor works how you work by allowing you to add recipes to posts, pages or custom post types.
- **Featured Image Support**: You only have to set one image for your post or page if you use featured images. If you don't provide a recipe image, Zip Recipes will add the featured image to Google's rich snippet.
- **No coding required**: We made Zip Recipes easy to use so you don’t need computer knowledge to start publishing your recipes. Even a complete novice can do it!
- **Extensive support through knowledge base articles and responsive supportdesk

## Rank higher in Google
- **Schema.org and JSON LD**: your recipes will include all the necessary microdata so Google understands them, and will show rich snippets
- **Mobile friendly**: your recipes will look good on any device.
- **AMP compatible**: out of the box compatible with Google's Accelerated Mobile pages. Zip Recipes will make your recipes load instantly from Google results.

## Professional look
Some readers need a lot of information before even trying to re-create your recipe. That’s why .
- **Nutrition information**: Zip Recipes includes nutrition information, cook and prep time, notes and more
- **Rich Snippets**: When users search for recipes, Google will show them the rich snippets with image, rating, nutrition info, cook and preptime, etc.
- **Slick print layout**: When clicking the print button, your users will get a beautiful formatted print view.

Here is how we help you compete with professional recipe websites that have thousands of dollars in marketing budget:

- With instruction images, you help your readers easily follow along and re-create your recipe like you’re there holding their hand
- Add a schema.org compatible video to your recipe
- Highlight or draw attention to specific ingredients or steps by formatting the recipe text
- Make your recipe accessible to your readers on their phone, tablet, or desktop computer or on paper (print-friendly format)
- Modify your recipe card by changing borders, image size, ingredient & instruction list format, and labels
- Allowing your readers to clearly separate different components of your recipe through multi-part recipes (for example, cake and icing)
- Use any WordPress free or paid website themes

##Your Recipes are Yours Only
Since you create your recipes, you should be the one to benefit from them. That’s why we don’t publish your recipes on our website. We help *you* build a following and don’t compete with you.

To further help bring more readers to your blog, the images you add to your recipe will automatically contain information for better SEO (Search engine optimization) through the use of ALT image attributes.

## More Readers from Pinterest

Pinterest can also be a huge source of readers for your blog as well. With our JSON-LD recipe markup, your recipes will appear on Pinterest as Rich Recipe Pins. People looking for your type of recipes will discover them and click over to your website giving you an excellent opportunity to build a fan base.

##Integrates with ad networks

Zip Recipes also works with major ad platforms like Google Adsense, Adthrive and Mediavine. This is another alternative to help you monetize your blog.

##Affiliate Marketing

You get paid through affiliate marketing when you link an ingredient or tool to an online retailer like Amazon. Each time your readers click on the link and buy from the retailer, you get paid a commission fee. With Zip Recipes this is easy to do. [See here how](https://ziprecipes.net/knowledge-base/formatting/)

## Recipe Membership Website

With the help of plugins like Memberful or WishList Member, you can create a recipe membership website and use Zip Recipes to publish recipes for paying members only.

This is an excellent way to start earning an income once you establish a following.

Or build a community of Recipe lovers with Ultimate Member, which is a beautiful tool to build communities and interact with them.

= How do I edit a recipe with the Zip Recipes plugin? =

To edit or create a recipe, click the Zip Recipes icon on the visual editor toolbar, or in Gutenberg, type in "zip", then click the Zip Recipes icon. More info [here](https://ziprecipes.net/knowledge-base/how-to-use-the-zip-recipes-plugin/).

= Can I use the plugin to add multiple recipes to one post or page? =

There should only be one recipe per post or page. The plugin does allow for compound recipes which is one way to include multiple lists of ingredients in your post. Under “creating a recipe” in the following article you can read how to do that.  [Click here to learn more](https://ziprecipes.net/knowledge-base/how-to-use-the-zip-recipes-plugin/

= When I use Zip Recipe plugin where are the recipes stored? =

Your recipes are always stored on your own website. With Zip Recipes, your recipes are stored safely in a separate database table in your main WordPress database. The recipe table is named wp_amd_zlrecipe_recipes and you can take a look at it yourself using any WordPress database tools at your disposal.

= How about Intellectual Property? =

Your recipes are yours only! They're stored on your own server. Zip Recipes is only a tool to show your recipes on the internet.

= Why do you put a placeholder image into my Edit Post page, instead of my actual recipe? =

Because of the way WordPress' text editor works, if you decide to add or remove something from your recipe using the text editor, it can very easily mess up the markup of the code - so the Zip Recipe plugin prevents that from happening by not allowing you to edit the recipe in the text editor.
